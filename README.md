## Golden Rules

Hard-won lessons from 4 execution runs:

1. **Schema Discovery First** -- Always send an empty call to discover the real schema. Documentation may have wrong parameter names.
2. **Read Error Messages** -- Distinguish between param validation, auth blocks, and backend errors.
3. **Don't Fabricate Timelines** -- Use actual API timestamps.
4. **Poll Async Tasks** -- Many operations return a `task_id`. Poll with `get_otto_task_status` until `SUCCESS`.
5. **Watch for Tool Name Collisions** -- Multiple tools share the same short name. The MCP server routes to the first match in the registry.

See [`AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`](AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md) for the full battle manual.

## Quick Start

1. Get an API key for the SearchAtlas Agentic Omnichannel Marketing MCP server

3. Run tool discovery:
   ```bash
   ./discover_tools.sh
   ```
4. Start marketing.

## CLI Installation

The `searchatlas_cli.py` provides a rich terminal interface to all 112 MCP tools — no curl required.
